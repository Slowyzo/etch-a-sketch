Etch-a-Sketch

A simple js version of the classic childrens toy with customizable range and random color mode

This project took some time, but added functionality was a good learning experience, and I did not find it too difficult. I relied heavily on google, and at times ChatGPT for clarifying problems and suggesting ways to improve the code.

Future versions could include a slider for resizing the grid, an eraser, and a mouse-hold/drag eventlistener for more fine control. Some quirks still exist - cannot switch back to rainbow mode without resetting the grid at this time.

Almost done Odin Project Foundations!
